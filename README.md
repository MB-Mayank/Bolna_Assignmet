# Bolna-Google Sheets Integration

A robust Flask-based integration that automates voice calls using Bolna AI and tracks call data in real-time through Google Sheets. This system provides intelligent call management with retry logic, real-time updates, and comprehensive call tracking.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Automated Voice Calls**: Initiates calls through Bolna AI API to phone numbers listed in Google Sheets
- **Real-time Tracking**: Updates call status, duration, and results instantly via webhooks
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Intelligently retries failed calls while avoiding duplicates
- **Background Processing**: Continuous monitoring and processing of pending calls
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Prevents duplicate calls and ensures data consistency

### Call Management
- **Status Tracking**: Monitors call progression from initiation to completion
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Active call tracking prevents multiple calls to the same number
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging and monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with automatic recovery

### Data Integration
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Direct read/write access to spreadsheet data
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant status updates via webhook callbacks
- **Transcript Storage**: Saves call transcripts and summaries to the sheet
- **Call Analytics**: Tracks call duration, outcomes, and detailed notes

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Components
1. **Flask Web Server**: Handles webhook callbacks and provides API endpoints
2. **Background Worker**: Continuously processes pending calls and cleanup tasks
3. **Google Sheets Client**: Manages spreadsheet operations and data synchronization
4. **Bolna API Client**: Handles voice call initiation and management

### Data Flow
```
Google Sheets ‚Üí Background Worker ‚Üí Bolna API ‚Üí Voice Call ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Google Sheets
```

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Services
- **Bolna AI Account**: For voice call capabilities
- **Google Cloud Project**: For Sheets API access
- **Google Sheets**: Pre-configured spreadsheet with proper columns

### Python Dependencies
```
flask
gspread
oauth2client
requests
threading
logging
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables
```python
CREDENTIALS_FILE = "eminent-crane-434217-a2-8bc0bb699e19.json"  # Google Service Account
SHEET_URL = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/..."        # Target Google Sheet
API_TOKEN = "bn-f9c"              # Bolna API Token
AGENT_ID = "5c73"              # Bolna Agent ID
```

### Google Sheets Structure
Required columns:
- **A**: Name (Customer name)
- **B**: Phone Number (Format: +1234567890)
- **C**: Status (Call status)
- **D**: Latest Execution ID (Bolna execution ID)
- **E**: Duration (Call duration in seconds)
- **F**: Last Attempt Time (Timestamp)
- **G**: Notes (Error messages, hangup reasons)
- **H**: Transcript (Call transcript)
- **I**: Summary (Call summary)

## üîÑ How It Works

### 1. Call Initiation Process
- Background worker scans Google Sheets every 2 minutes
- Identifies pending calls based on status and timing rules
- Normalizes phone numbers for consistency
- Initiates calls through Bolna API with customer data
- Updates sheet with "initiating" then "initiated" status

### 2. Smart Retry Logic
```python
Retry Conditions:
- New/Empty Status: Immediate processing
- Failed Calls: Retry after 10+ minutes
- No Answer/Busy: Retry after 10+ minutes
- Active Calls: No retry if recent (<5 minutes)
- Completed Calls: NEVER retry
```

### 3. Real-time Updates via Webhooks
- Bolna sends webhook notifications for call events
- System processes status changes, duration, transcripts
- Google Sheets updated immediately with new data
- Active call tracking prevents duplicates

### 4. Status Management
**Call Statuses:**
- `pending/new` ‚Üí Ready for calling
- `initiating` ‚Üí Call being set up
- `initiated` ‚Üí Call in progress
- `ringing` ‚Üí Phone ringing
- `answered` ‚Üí Call connected
- `completed` ‚Üí Call finished successfully
- `failed/busy/no-answer` ‚Üí Retry eligible
- `call-disconnected` ‚Üí Call ended

### 5. Background Maintenance
- Cleans up stale active calls (>15 minutes)
- Processes one call per cycle to avoid overwhelming
- Rate limiting between calls (5-second intervals)
- Comprehensive error logging and recovery

## üìä Webhook Data Processing

### Incoming Webhook Format
```json
{
  "id": "execution_id",
  "status": "completed",
  "context_details": {
    "recipient_phone_number": "+1234567890"
  },
  "telephony_data": {
    "duration": "45.2",
    "hangup_reason": "caller_hangup"
  },
  "transcript": "Call transcript...",
  "summary": "Call summary...",
  "smart_status": "successful_call"
}
```

*This integration provides a complete automated calling solution with enterprise-grade reliability and real-time tracking capabilities.*
