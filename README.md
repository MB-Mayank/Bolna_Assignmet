# üìû Bolna-Google Sheets Integration

A robust **Flask-based integration** that automates voice calls using **Bolna AI** and tracks call data in **real-time** through Google Sheets.  
This system provides **intelligent call management** with retry logic, real-time updates, and comprehensive call tracking.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- A Flask server set up to receive webhook events  
- An account with [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com)

---

## ‚ö° Steps

### 1. Install Ngrok
Download and install Ngrok from [here](https://ngrok.com/download).

### 2. Start Your Flask Server
Run your Flask integration locally:


python app.py


By default, Flask runs on:
`http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### 3. Expose Flask with Ngrok

In a new terminal, start an Ngrok tunnel:

```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

Ngrok will provide a public URL, such as:

```
Forwarding https://a1b2c3d4.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000
```

### 4. Configure Webhook in Bolna Dashboard

* Go to the **Bolna Dashboard**
* Navigate to **Your Agent ‚Üí Webhooks**
* Add the Ngrok URL with your webhook endpoint, for example:

```
https://a1b2c3d4.ngrok.io/webhook/bolna
```

### 5. Test the Webhook

* Trigger a call using the Bolna sheet or API
* Bolna will send webhook updates to your Flask server via Ngrok
* Check your Flask console to confirm that webhook events are being logged

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Ngrok URLs change each time you restart the tunnel unless you use a paid plan with reserved domains.
üëâ Update the webhook URL in the Bolna Dashboard whenever the Ngrok URL changes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

```python
CREDENTIALS_FILE = "eminent-crane-434217-a2-8bc0bb699e19.json"  # Google Service Account
SHEET_URL       = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/..."  # Target Google Sheet
API_TOKEN       = "bn-f9c"                                      # Bolna API Token
AGENT_ID        = "5c73"                                        # Bolna Agent ID
```

### Google Sheets Structure

Required columns:

| Column | Field               | Description                    |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| A      | Name                | Customer name                  |
| B      | Phone Number        | Format: +1234567890            |
| C      | Status              | Call status                    |
| D      | Latest Execution ID | Bolna execution ID             |
| E      | Duration            | Call duration in seconds       |

## üîÑ How It Works

### 1. Call Initiation Process

* Background worker scans Google Sheets every **2 minutes**
* Identifies pending calls based on status and timing rules
* Normalizes phone numbers for consistency
* Initiates calls through Bolna API with customer data
* Updates sheet with **"initiating" ‚Üí "initiated"** status

### 2. Smart Retry Logic

**Retry Conditions:**

* New/Empty Status ‚Üí Immediate processing
* Failed Calls ‚Üí Retry after **10+ minutes**
* No Answer/Busy ‚Üí Retry after **10+ minutes**
* Active Calls ‚Üí No retry if recent (<5 minutes)
* Completed Calls ‚Üí ‚ùå Never retry

### 3. Real-time Updates via Webhooks

* Bolna sends webhook notifications for call events
* System processes status changes, duration, transcripts
* Google Sheets updated immediately with new data
* Active call tracking prevents duplicates

### 4. Status Management

**Call Statuses:**

```
pending/new       ‚Üí Ready for calling
initiating        ‚Üí Call being set up
initiated         ‚Üí Call in progress
ringing           ‚Üí Phone ringing
answered          ‚Üí Call connected
completed         ‚Üí Call finished successfully
failed/busy/no-answer ‚Üí Retry eligible
call-disconnected ‚Üí Call ended
```

### 5. Background Maintenance

* Cleans up stale active calls (>15 minutes)
* Processes **one call per cycle** to avoid overwhelming
* Rate limiting between calls (**5-second intervals**)
* Comprehensive error logging and recovery

Would you like me to also create a **GitHub badges section** (Python version, Flask, Google Sheets API, Ngrok) at the top for extra polish?
